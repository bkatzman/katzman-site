            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a junior at the University of Georgia
              triple majoring in Mathematics, Economics, and Political Science. My current
              ojective is to obtain a data analytics or strategic decision focused internship 	      where I can apply the
              quantitative abilities developed in my coursework while leveraging my
              proficiency in R, Python, SQL, and Excel. I possess strong problem solving
              and self-directed learning skills and would like to gain hands-on experience
              applying analytics to sports, business, or politics.
            </p>

                  This paper with Dr. Keith Dougherty (UGA Political Science) is the product of my second semester of Undergraduate Research. It examines alternative versions of Ranked Choice Voting to compare how they perform according to various criteria based on their elimination rule. Real world and simulated elections are examined using R (R Studio). The paper is currently in the revise and resubmit stage at the journal Public Choice.

It examines three different elimination methods for Ranked Choice Voting systems under various social choice criteria. The research required using R to code simulations of candidate rankings for voters and assessed and compared winners. It also contains a theoretical mathematical proof regarding outcomes in Ranked Choice Voting with Borda Count elimination.</p>
